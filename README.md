📊 Competitor Analysis Dashboard — Ride-Hailing Market in Ghana

🚀 Project Overview

This dashboard is my first-ever data analytics dashboard, created as part of the AI Skills Fellowship Program by AI Skills Africa.
The objective was to analyze the performance of major ride-hailing companies operating in Ghana and uncover insights into market share, revenue trends, and driver activity.

This project marks a significant milestone in my analytics journey—transforming raw operational data into a visually compelling, insight-driven dashboard.

🎯 Problem Statement

With the increasing growth of ride-hailing services, understanding market dynamics, customer demand, and revenue distribution has become essential.
However, the companies operate independently, with no single source to compare performance.
This dashboard solves that problem by providing a consolidated view of the top market players.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains monthly operational performance metrics for the following companies:

➡️ Bolt

➡️ Shaxi

➡️ Uber

➡️ Yango

It includes:

Metric	Description
➡️ Total Revenue	Monthly revenue generated
➡️ Total Bookings	Number of confirmed trips
➡️ Active Drivers	Drivers available to take rides

Total dataset summary:

➡️ 582,645 Total Rides

➡️ GHS 3,437,928 Total Revenue

➡️ 1,505,624 Active Drivers

🔧 Tools & Skills Demonstrated

This project showcased my ability to apply core data analytics skills:

| **Design Thinking**    | Branding, color psychology & storytelling           |

📈 Key Insights

➡️ Bolt and Uber lead revenue in different months, but Bolt consistently attracts more active drivers.

➡️ Uber generated the highest bookings with 15,031 rides, representing 40% of the total bookings.

➡️ Yango shows strong growth potential despite having fewer rides, backed by 59,409 GHS revenue.

➡️ Shaxi has the lowest market share, signaling room for expansion or strategic repositioning.

These insights highlight competitive strengths and opportunities within the Ghanaian ride-hailing ecosystem.
